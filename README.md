That is the fork of the original project created by [@tfoldi](https://twitter.com/tfoldi).

### Prerequisites

- Docker has be installed. Run `docker version` to verify.
- Since Tableau Server itself has some requirements to the host machine, you need to change [the advanced settings](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#advanced) for docker to grant it 8Gb of memory and 8 cores of CPU.
